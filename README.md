# stochest

A testing framework for stochastical/randomized algorithms

The goal of this crate is to provide a simple proc-macro, `#[stochest]`, which provides
infrastructure to test randomized algorithms and systems.

The main goal of this crate for now is to provide for the needs of the `unhindered-ec` project, which
this is a part of.
(See [here](https://github.com/unhindered-ec/unhindered-ec) for more information on that).

Although if you wish to use this project for another purpose, and features for that are missing,
contributions are always welcome :) Feel free to open a issue to discuss your Idea before spending a
bunch of time on creating your pr.
